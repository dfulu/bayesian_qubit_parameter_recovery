# bayesian_qubit_parameter_recovery

This is a very messy repository for a computational research course I did in my third year of university. 

In the project I do Monte Carlo simulations of a qubit oscillating in a driving field and from this extract the emissive decay signal (the times when the qubit emits a photon). Following this I show how you can use Bayesian inference to recover the physical properties of the qubit using the times of emission alone. Neat!
